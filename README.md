# Medicore Hospital Management System

A Python-based Hospital Management System designed to manage
patients, doctors, and administrators through a console-based
interface.

The system supports appointment booking, medical record
management, and includes a basic machine learning module
for disease prediction based on symptoms.

This project was developed as part of my learning in Python,
healthcare workflows, and applied machine learning concepts.
